To change now:

- make the zigzag primitive


- 5 lasers : do an array of laser object (then laser will be an object, not a namespace!)
- then we need to make a color struct with five 12 bit values! (and blanking?)
- put the corresponding pins in a const array (in utils or in the laserController.h)


To change later:
- do "laserPoint" struct, not only P2, so we can store color.
- color state in REnbderer2d state variables? (there is only one object anyway...)
- do a proper vector2D class

... in fact all this is already in my former mbed code !!!!!!
